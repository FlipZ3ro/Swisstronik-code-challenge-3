# Swisstronik code challenge #3

## Challenge task: create, deploy and show off your ERC20 token contract using Hardhat

1. Function Deploy
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network swisstronik
```

2. Function Mint
```
npx hardhat run scripts/mint.js --network swisstronik
```

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
